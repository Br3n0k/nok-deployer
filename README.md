**Nok-Deployer** is a lightweight yet powerful deployment tool and VS Code extension designed to automate file synchronization between your local environment and multiple remote servers.
It supports **FTP, SFTP, and SSH**, allowing seamless integration with a wide range of hosting environments.

Unlike traditional one-target deployers, Nok-Deployer introduces a **multi-server and multi-target architecture**, enabling you to:

* Assign **specific folders** to specific servers
* Deploy a folder to **one**, **several**, or **all servers**

This creates a flexible and intelligent deployment pipeline ideal for complex setups, microservices, or distributed environments.
